* Future Work
- finding equivalent of inspect._empty in python2 (unable to google)
- importing python classes, and methods, may be, as subclasses 
  of 'python-object; to be able to use make-instance and slot-value 
  might require knowledge of MOP, to make python-object at the same level
  as standard-object
- should return value of defpyfun matter - so as to indicate success or failure?
  failure is anyways indicated by errors
- ability to define customized arg-lists, documentation, and calling methods
  for functions: this can serve as a community project to cover up some 
  naming and arg-list idiosyncrasies
- cleaning up documentation while defining functions - many python functions 
  have documentation intended for use directly in md/rst files
